**Timber** is an **open-source** [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll "Link to Jekyll project") theme. It implements a **responsive layout** with HTML5/CSS3/jQuery, **post tagging** and **social media integration**. Deploying a Timber site **couldn't be simpler**: set a handful of configuration options and provide some content for this "blurb" section. **For more detail** on how to get Timber, customise and deploy it, take a look at the [project page](https://www.github.com/bytes42/timber/ "GitHub project page for Timber").
